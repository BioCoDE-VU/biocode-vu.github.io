**Background**
<br>
A group of scientists within the Fraser lab have begun a journal club centered around issues of diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice within academia, specifically in the biological sciences.

Our goal is to provide an environment for continued learning, critical discussion, and brainstorming action items that individuals and labs can implement. Our discussions and proposed interventions reflect our own opinions based on our personal identities and lived experiences, and may differ from the identities and experiences of others. We will recap our discussions and proposed action items through a series of blog posts, and encourage readers to directly engage with DEIJ practitioners and their scholarship to improve your environment.

*This blog post will be updated on a monthly basis to include new journal club discussions.*



**April 8th, 2022 – Land Acknowledgments**


**Discussion Leader:** [Roberto Efraín (Robbie) Díaz](/members/#Roberto%20Efraín%20(Robbie)%20Díaz)


**Article:** The limits of settlers’ territorial acknowledgments. Asher L, Curnow J & Davis A (2018) DOI: [10.1080/03626784.2018.1468211](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03626784.2018.1468211)


**Summary:** There has been an increase in the performance of land acknowledgments by non-Indigenous people in non-Indigenous, primarily academic settler, spaces. This article examines what purpose do these land acknowledgments serve, who are they for, and can land acknowledgments performed by settlers be improved to better reflect the original intentions of Indigenous people who created this practice?


**Key Points:**
- Settlers perform land acknowledgments as a means of combating the erasure of Indigenous people.
	- The pedagogical intention has been to combat erasure and force settlers to grapple with our positionality.
- In becoming standardized and mainstream, it is reduced to a “mundane “box-ticking” exercise, easily ignored and void of learning opportunities.”
- Settler moves to innocence are those strategies or positionings that attempt to relieve the settler of feelings of guilt or responsibility without giving up land or power or privilege, without having to change much at all.
- The practice needs to be improved to avoid becoming rote and normalized.


**Open Questions:**
- What pedagogical work do territorial acknowledgments accomplish in settler spaces?
- What do people learn from a territorial acknowledgment and does it serve any decolonial purpose?
- Are territorial acknowledgments productive in disrupting avoidance mechanisms and pushing settlers towards decolonial solidarity?


**Proposed Action Items:**
- Begin including an intentional and well-researched land acknowledgment in your presentations.
- Include specific examples of how settlers can contribute to decolonial efforts.




**May 6th, 2022 – The Minority Tax**


**Discussion Leader:** [Stephanie Wankowicz](/members/#Stephanie%20Wankowicz)


**Article:** Addressing racism through ownership. Dutt, K. DOI: [10.1038/s41561-021-00688-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-021-00688-2)


**Article:** Black Scientists Are Not the Door to Diversity. Hayes, CA. DOI: [10.1021/acschemneuro.1c00375](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acschemneuro.1c00375)


**Article:** The Burden of Service for Faculty of Color to Achieve Diversity and Inclusion: The Minority Tax. Trejo J. DOI: [10.1091/mbc.E20-08-0567](https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/10.1091/mbc.E20-08-0567)


**Summary:** Marginalized people are expected to dismantle oppressive systems that actively disenfranchise them, an expectation known as the Minority Tax. How does this tax impact people at different stages of their career, and how do we combat this expectation?


**Key Points:**
- Successful DEIJ work takes teamwork.
- There is a lack of respect for DEIJ work.
	- This is most obvious in the deliberate exclusion of DEI work from traditional metrics of professional progress, such as promotion and funding.
	- Universities are often recognized and praised for the contributions of individuals to DEIJ work.
- There is a lack of support for DEIJ work.
	-	This work is rarely done by an expert. Instead, those with lived experiences are often tasked with developing and implementing DEI efforts. This model results in mixed outcomes while allowing universities to claim they support DEIJ initiatives.


**Open Questions**
- How do we get more people involved in DEIJ work?
- What do you do with people who are not interested in contributing to DEIJ?
- How do we track and reward DEIJ effort among academic personnel?
- How do we evaluate the impact of diversity efforts in academia?
- Is it appropriate for basic scientists to create and lead DEIJ efforts?


**Proposed Action Items:**
- Estimate how much time you are spending on DEIJ work compared to others. Take note of who shows up to meetings, comes up with ideas, and executes those ideas.
- Increase the importance of service work, specifically DEIJ work, in tenure and promotion decisions.
- Provide material resources, such as hiring full-time staff or providing money for consultants, to implement DEIJ projects or initiatives.
