description: "Adrian graduated from UCLA in 2024 with a degree in Biophysics. As an undergraduate, he conducted research at the Terasaki Institute under [Dr. Yangzhi Zhu](https://terasaki.org/institute/research/investigators/yangzhi-zhu-laboratory.html), focusing on wearable technology, and worked in [Dr. Matteo Pellegrini's lab](https://medschool.ucla.edu/people/matteo-pellegrini-phd) applying machine learning to fungal phylogenetics. Adrian is particularly passionate about utilizing deep learning techniques to address fundamental questions in biophysics. 

Outside of the lab, you can often find him rock climbing, looking for new camping spots, or enjoying live music."
