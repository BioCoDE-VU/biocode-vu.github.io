description: "Stephanie earned her bachelor's degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. There she performed research on the economics of the Clean Water Act under Dr. Paul Kolkoswki. 



After graduating, she worked as a Data Specialists at [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](https://www.dana-farber.org/) in the [Lank Center for Genitourinary Oncology](https://www.dana-farber.org/cancer-care/treatment/genitourinary-cancer). She managed the Bladder Cancer Translational Research Center under the direction of [Dr. Joaquim Bellmunt](http://bellmuntoncologia.com). She performed clinical and translational research where she helped identify the relationship between the expression of PD-L1, an immune checkpoint marker, and overall survival in metastatic bladder cancer. 



Subsequently, she worked as a computational biologist at [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](https://www.dana-farber.org/) and the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/). Here, she developed algorithms that utilize high-throughput genomics data to assess responses to oncology treatment. She led the largest study of prostate cancer exomes, identifying new genes and pathways commonly mutated in prostate cancer. She also helped identify genetic biomarkers identifying patient responses to immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and chemotherapy. 



In 2018, she began her graduate career in the [Biophysics program at UCSF](https://biophysics.ucsf.edu/) working in [James Fraserâ€™s lab](https://fraserlab.com/). Here, she developed computational tools to automatically construct conformational ensembles from X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM data, extracting low-populated, but biologically important states of macromolecules. Leveraging structural bioinformatics, she uncovered the spatial redistribution of entropy in ligand binding. She was supported by graduate fellowships from [NSF](http://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and the [UCSF Discovery Fellows Program](https://graduate.ucsf.edu/discovery-fellows-program). 



In 2024, Stephanie opened her lab at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/) in the [Molecular Physiology and Biophysics Department](https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/mpb/), [Center for AI in Protein Dynamics](https://www.ai-proteindynamics.org/), and [Center for Structural Biology](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csb/). The lab has two main areas of research: (1) improving the modeling of structural conformational ensembles from X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM data by leveraging generative AI, (2) elucidating the structural mechanisms by which conformational entropy influences binding specificity and catalysis. Find out more about our current research in the [research tab](/research).



Intertwined with her science, Stephanie is interested in improving equity and inclusion in science. Her work has spanned from starting a mentorship program for the [Biophysics program at UCSF](https://biophysics.ucsf.edu/) and starting a DEIJ Journal Club in the [Fraser lab](https://fraserlab.com/tags/deij_jc/). She will be continuing these efforts at Vanderbilt.



Outside of lab, you are most likely to find Stephanie running in a park or on a trail!"
