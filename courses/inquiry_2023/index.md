# Inquiry Immersion 2023 - DRUG DESIGN: Personal Genome Interpretation in the post-AlphaFold world #

**INSTRUCTORS**

- [James Fraser](mailto:jfraser@fraserlab.com) (Lead Instructor)

**LOCATION**

Varies day by day (see schedule)! How exciting...

**OVERVIEW**

Alphafold is one of the buzziest breakthroughs of recent years. What does it mean to predict a structure of a protein and how is that useful for: 1) designing new drugs and 2) interpreting genomes?

**MINI COURSE OBJECTIVES**

- Identify an urgent and significant gap in medical knowledge and/or practice.
- Propose rationale and novel strategies to address that gap in medical knowledge and/or practice using tools and techniques germane to the relevant Domain(s) of Science.
- Engage with researchers working on the topic explored and collaborate on potential scholarly research.

**TOPIC OBJECTIVES**

- Employ visualization software to examine alphafold models
- Model mutations in protein stuctures
- Examine the interactions between proteins and small molecules

**MINI COURSE DEI Focus**

- The role of "who owns" genomes will be discussed.
