# Our research
Our atomistic understanding of enzyme specificity is driven primarily by static interactions between a substrate and catalytic residues, ignoring the critical component of protein dynamics. Dynamics affect binding and catalysis by enabling proteins to access various states and altering the thermodynamics associated with these processes through entropy. However, the influence of dynamics is frequently underestimated because of the complexities in modeling multiple states and quantifying entropy. 

Our overall goal is to elucidate the role of entropy in substrate recognition and catalysis, aiming to provide a more comprehensive thermodynamic understanding of enzyme function.
