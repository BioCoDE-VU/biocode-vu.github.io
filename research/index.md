## The lab has two main areas of research: 

(1) improving the modeling of structural conformational ensembles from X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM data by leveraging optimization algorithms and generative AI.

(2) elucidating the structural mechanisms by which conformational entropy influences binding specificity and catalysis. 


### Modeling of Conformational Ensembles <br>


We also are the main developers of [qFit](https://github.com/ExcitedStates/qfit-3.0), along with the [James Fraser](https://fraserlab.com/) and [Daniel Keedy](https://keedylab.org/) labs.  




### Structural Mechanisms of Conformational Entropy <br>

The understanding of ligand specificity is foundational to the biochemistry of living organisms. However, our atomistic understanding of enzyme specificity is driven primarily by static interactions between a substrate and catalytic residues, ignoring the critical component of protein dynamics. Dynamics affect binding and catalysis by enabling proteins to access various states and altering the thermodynamics associated with these processes through entropy. However, the influence of dynamics is frequently underestimated because of the complexities in modeling multiple states and quantifying entropy. 

Our overall goal is to elucidate the role of entropy in substrate recognition and catalysis, aiming to provide a more comprehensive thermodynamic understanding of enzyme function. 

We attack this problem by combining novel modeling strategies, machine learning, and biophysical measurements to determine how entropy influences proteins.
