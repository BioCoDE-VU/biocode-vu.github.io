  <br>
  
The Biomedical and Computational Discovery Experience (BioCoDE) invites high school students to explore what biomedical research is. This experience is geared towards students with no background or experience in biomedical research and who want to get a taste of what biomedical research is all about. 

This program is in collaboration with the [Center for AI in Protein Dynamics](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/ai-proteindynamics/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/).
  <br>
  <br>

*Our Mission* is to provide an accessible opportunity for students with no prior background to explore the what, how, why, and who of biomedical research.
