  Welcome to the Wankowicz lab. Our main areas of research include:
  - *Improving the modeling of structural conformational ensembles from X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM data by leveraging optimization algorithms and generative AI.*
  - *Elucidating the structural mechanisms by which conformational entropy influences binding specificity and catalysis.* <br>

  <br>

  <br>
  We are part of the [Molecular Physiology & Biophysics Department](https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/mpb/), the [Center for AI in Protein Dynamics](https://www.ai-proteindynamics.org/), and the [Center for Structural Biology](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csb/) at Vanderbilt University.

  We are located in Light Hall at Vanderbilt University.
