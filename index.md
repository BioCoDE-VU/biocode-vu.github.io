## Welcome to the Wankowicz Lab
{: .display-4}

Our main areas of research include: 
- Improving the modeling of structural conformational ensembles from X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM data by leveraging optimization algorithms and generative AI.
- Elucidating the structural mechanisms by which conformational entropy influences binding specificity and catalysis.
