  Welcome to the Wankowicz lab. 
  <br>
  <br>
The Wankowicz lab aims to elucidate the role of entropy in substrate specificity and catalysis, providing a more comprehensive thermodynamic understanding of enzyme function. To achieve this, we develop computational algorithms to enhance the modeling of conformational ensembles from X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM. Using these improved models, biophysical measurements, and machine learning, we investigate how conformational and solvent entropy impacts binding specificity and catalysis.
