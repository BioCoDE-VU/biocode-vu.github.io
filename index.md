  **Welcome to the Wankowicz lab. We develop methods to improve the modeling of conformational ensembles from X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM and use those methods to investigate how conformational entropy influences binding specificity and catalysis.**

  <br>

  <br>
  We are part of the [Molecular Physiology & Biophysics Department](https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/mpb/), the [Center for AI in Protein Dynamics](https://www.ai-proteindynamics.org/), and the [Center for Structural Biology](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csb/) at Vanderbilt University.

  We are located in Light Hall at Vanderbilt University.
