  Our main areas of research include:
  - **Improving the modeling of structural conformational ensembles from X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM data by leveraging optimization algorithms and generative AI.**
  - **Elucidating the structural mechanisms by which conformational entropy influences binding specificity and catalysis.** <br>

  We are part of the [Molecular Physiology & Biophysics Department](https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/mpb/), the [Center for AI in Protein Dynamics](https://www.ai-proteindynamics.org/), and the [Center for Structural Biology](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csb/) at Vanderbilt University.

  We are located in Light Hall at Vanderbilt University.
