  Welcome to the Wankowicz lab. 
  <br>
  <br>
The Wankowicz lab works on discovering the structural mechanisms of binding and catalysis, the foundations for the biochemistry of living systems. While we can biochemically measure enzyme-substrate interactions, we often lack the structural mechanism underlying these measurements, limiting our ability to explain enzyme function, signaling pathways, and how drugs or mutations impact function and disease. 

We aim to change this paradigm by developing computational algorithms and experimental approaches to more completely structurally explain these biochemical measurements, focusing on metrics of entropy.

  We are part of the [Molecular Physiology & Biophysics Department](https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/mpb/), the [Center for AI in Protein Dynamics](https://www.ai-proteindynamics.org/), and the [Center for Structural Biology](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csb/) at Vanderbilt University.

 The lab is located in 735 Light Hall.
