  <br>
The Wankowicz lab works on determining the mechanisms driving the binding specificity and catalysis, viewing this problem from a thermodynamic and structural lens.

By leveraging machine learning, bioinformatics, and experimental approaches, we aim to identify structural conformational ensembles and evaluate how their enthalpic and entropic contributions impact binding specificity and catalysis.
