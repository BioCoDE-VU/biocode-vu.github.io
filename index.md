  Welcome to the Wankowicz lab. 
  <br>
  <br>
  We are exploring the structural basis of entropy's role in modulating binding specificity and catalytic activity. To achieve this, we develop computational algorithms to improve the modeling of conformational ensembles from X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM. Using these improved models, along with biophysical measurements, we are parsing out how conformational entropy with macromolecules, alongside solvent entropy, impacts binding specificity and catalysis.
